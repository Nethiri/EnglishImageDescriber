Task - Attention  
================
        
To capture the attention of your readers, you should start with a good introduction phrase(s).\n
Here are some examples you may use:

* If you look at this picture, you will see...
* In the picture you can see...   
* The picture shows... 
            
<textarea id="graphTextArea1" oninput="TBonChange(this)">Please enter text here!</textArea> \n

Task - Details
==============

Now that we have the attention of your reader, and we have a general understanding on what is been displayed, you should start looking at details.  \n
Here are some examples on how to continue:  \n

* The image we are looking at has been painted/taken at...
* When you look at the image, you can see that it is a black and white...
* This picture is a... picture and has been taken by...

<textarea id="graphTextArea2" oninput="TBonChange(this)">Please enter text here!</textArea>  \n

Okay... we should now have finished the intorduction of your discription.\n
So, now please describe the picture and use phrases like:\n
* In the foreground of the picture you will...
* In the background you can see that...
* In the right/left/center...
* Between ... there is...
* At the top/At the bottom there is...

<textarea id="graphTextArea3" oninput="TBonChange(this)">Please enter text here!</textArea>  \n

Now we know what we see on the picture. Lets focus now on who is doing what or what is going on.\n
To take some examples:\n
* The... is talking to...
* ... is gesturing to...

<textarea id="graphTextArea4" oninput="TBonChange(this)">Please enter text here!</textArea>  \n

Task-Your Opinion
=================

So, that all is fine and dandy, lets now focus on what you are thinking...\n
What do you think is the meaning of the picture?\n
Here are some examples:\n
* It seems as if...
* ... might be a symbol of ... because...
* I (don't) like ... because
* ... makes me think of ...

Prep-work:
================

Code descriptions are a bit more unorthodox than normal image descriptions.
So, what do we have to look for in a code description?

First of all, we have to figure out the context of this code...

Here are some examples which may help you to do just that: \n

* Looking at the code(snipped) as a whole, you can see that...
* This code(snipped) has been written in...
* This code(snipped) is a [...] which returns a...
            
<textarea id="graphTextArea1" oninput="TBonChange(this)">Please enter text here!</textArea> \n

What is this code all about? 
==============

Describe what you think it is used for, or where you have found it...

Some helpful examples:

* The [...] uses this [...] for...
* One might need this in...
* When you are [...] you might need a function like this to...

<textarea id="graphTextArea2" oninput="TBonChange(this)">Please enter text here!</textArea>  \n

Detailed analysis:
==============

Analyse the code now thoroughly. What can you see, what is written where, is there something interesting?
This might be achievable by looking at it line by line and will probably be the largest text(s) you'll need to write.

Here are some examples which might help you get started from the top:

* In the code provided the following imports are made...
* We make use of the [...] libraries...

<textarea id="graphTextArea3" oninput="TBonChange(this)">Please enter text here!</textArea>  \n

Continue with the line-by-line check to focus on individual functions and lines. 
Make note of things like efficiency, variable names or even comments, here are some phrases which might help: 

* In the [...] line you can see that it is a call to a...
* In Line [...] you can see, that variable [...] is defined with...
* In the next line, the previously defined [...] is used for...

<textarea id="graphTextArea4" oninput="TBonChange(this)">Please enter text here!</textArea>  \n

Become the compiler:
==============

Code is never perfect... have you spotted a mistake? Would this code run at all, or would the compiler just throw a warning or maybe even error?
Be critical and insightful, do you have improvements? Write about it and remember 'Be the compiler'.

Here are some examples which might help:

* In Line [...], the pointer to the variable [...] is used instead of the...
* The line has not been completed and there is a [...] missing at the end.
* The [...] of the function [...] is undefined.
